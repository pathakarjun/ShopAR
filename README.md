# ShopAR
In order to compile and run this program, you will have to download packages. This program uses Flutter so after downloading Flutter, you will need to use the command "flutter pub get *package*" and replace the "package" with what package you are downloading. The reason these packages are needed to be downloaded is because they are not actual files withing our project, but rather, references to files that are found online and are downloaded as the project is run.
The packages used in this project are :</br>
- cupertino_icons</br>
- firebase_auth</br>
- firebase_core</br>
- google_fonts</br>
- cloud_firestore</br>
- expandable_text</br>
- arkit_plugin</br>
- firebase_storage</br>
- get</br>
- fluttertoast</br>
- flutter_svg</br>
- flutter_screenutil</br>
- ar_flutter_plugin</br>
- flutter_archive</br>
</br>
Once you have those, you can go into an IDE such as Android studio and, using a simulator or connected mobile device, run the program.</br>
</br>
Option 2: Another way to run it is to download all the packages mentioned above, and the use the command "flutter run" when in the main directory or the project. If a device such as a mobile phone is connected, it will start the program on that device, otherwise it will start it using the main browser on the computer.
